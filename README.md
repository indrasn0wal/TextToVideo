# TextToVideo
This repository contains a Python project that uses the DiffusionPipeline from the diffusers library to generate videos from text prompts. The generated videos are included in this repository for reference.
## Overview
Text-to-Video Generator is an innovative project that uses advanced generative AI models to create short videos from textual descriptions. By harnessing the power of the ```damo-vilab/text-to-video-ms-1.7b``` model from the ```diffusers``` library, this project enables users to input simple text prompts and generate visually compelling video content.
## Example Videos
Here are some example videos generated using the pipeline:
- **Dog Eating a Slice of Pizza**

- **Spider Man surfing**
